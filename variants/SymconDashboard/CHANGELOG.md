## [1.0.6] – Multi-URL Pages & Window controls

### Added
- **Multiple pages support:** Any number of named pages (URL + display name) can
  now be configured. The first entry in the list is the startup/default page.
- **Pages tray submenu:** The system-tray menu now has a *Pages* submenu that
  lists all configured pages with a checkmark on the active one. Clicking a
  page navigates to it immediately.
- **Drag-bar page controls:** A list-icon button (⊞) on the left side of the
  drag bar opens a flyout menu for quick page switching. The current page name
  is shown as a label next to it and remains fully draggable (HTCAPTION).
- **Page Manager dialog:** *Manage pages…* opens a dialog with add (＋),
  remove (−), move-up (↑) and move-down (↓) operations. Each entry has a name
  and a URL field; changes are validated before saving.
- **Migration:** Existing installations with a single `StartUrl` setting are
  automatically migrated to the new `Pages` list on first launch.
- **Taskbar icon toggle:** A *Taskbar icon* checkmark entry in the app menu
  lets users control whether the application appears in the taskbar
  independently of borderless mode. The taskbar icon is shown by default.
- **Minimize button in drag bar:** A dedicated minimize button (`_`) is now shown
  in the drag bar between the kiosk and maximize/restore buttons. Full button
  order (left → right): Kiosk · Minimize · Maximize/Restore · Close.
- **Taskbar click minimizes/restores borderless window:** Clicking the taskbar
  button of a borderless window now correctly minimizes the active window and
  restores a minimized one. Root cause: `FormBorderStyle.None` windows lack
  `WS_MINIMIZEBOX` by default, so the Shell never sent `SC_MINIMIZE`. Fixed by
  adding `WS_MINIMIZEBOX` (0x00020000) via a `CreateParams` override (signals
  the Shell) and a `WM_ACTIVATE` handler (restore path, since `SC_RESTORE` is
  also not delivered to borderless windows).
- **Dedicated top resize border:** A `ResizeBorder`-high strip is now reserved
  at the very top of the borderless window — free of any child controls — so
  that `WM_NCHITTEST` reliably returns `HTTOP` and the window can be resized by
  dragging the top edge. Previously, the drag-bar labels started at y = 1 and
  blocked the hit-test message before it could reach the form's `WndProc`.
  The drag bar and all caption buttons now sit immediately below this strip
  (`top = ResizeBorder`); the layout is now fully symmetric on all four sides.
- **Edge snap (borderless mode):** While dragging or resizing the borderless
  window, any edge that comes within 16 px of a monitor's working-area boundary
  snaps flush to it. During a **move** (`WM_MOVING`), both axes are evaluated
  independently and the window size is always preserved; per axis the closest
  candidate across all connected monitors wins. During a **resize** (`WM_SIZING`),
  only the active grip edge snaps — the opposite edge stays fixed, so the window
  grows or shrinks exactly to the screen boundary. Kiosk mode is excluded.

### Changed
- **Close button (✕) exits the application:** The drag-bar close button now calls
  `Application.Exit()` instead of hiding the window to the tray. Use the tray
  icon or taskbar to show/hide the window; use ✕ or *Exit* in the tray menu to
  quit entirely.
- **Page Manager – Apply persists immediately:** Clicking *Apply* in the Page
  Manager saves changes right away. If the dialog is subsequently dismissed with
  *Cancel*, those applied changes are kept (`HasAppliedChanges` flag). Previously,
  cancelling after *Apply* silently discarded the changes.

## [1.0.5]

### Fixed
- **Kiosk mode – resize borders disabled:** In borderless kiosk mode, the resize
  borders are no longer draggable. `GetBorderlessHitTest` returns `HTCLIENT`
  immediately when kiosk is active.
- **Kiosk mode – drag bar hidden:** The drag strip at the top is no longer
  rendered in kiosk mode. WebView2 now fills the entire client area (`0, 0,
  Width, Height`) so there is no movable or right-clickable title area.
- **Kiosk mode – window buttons hidden:** All three caption buttons (kiosk,
  maximize/restore, close) are hidden while kiosk mode is active and restored
  when kiosk mode is exited.
- **Kiosk mode – uses current screen:** Kiosk mode now full-screens on the
  monitor the window is currently on (`Screen.FromHandle(Handle)`), not always
  on the primary monitor. This applies both when toggling and when restoring
  kiosk state on startup.
- **Maximized borderless – resize borders disabled:** When the window is
  maximized in borderless mode, the resize borders are no longer draggable.
  Only the drag strip (HTCAPTION) is kept so that dragging restores and moves
  the window as expected by Windows conventions.
- **Maximized borderless – taskbar no longer covered:** Handling `WM_GETMINMAXINFO`
  limits the maximized size to `Screen.WorkingArea`, so the taskbar stays
  visible on all monitors. Not applied in kiosk mode (intentional full-screen).
- **Maximized borderless – secondary monitor position:** `ptMaxPosition` in
  `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` is now computed relative to the monitor’s own origin
  (`wa.Left − screen.Bounds.Left`, `wa.Top − screen.Bounds.Top`) instead of
  virtual-screen coordinates. Previously, maximizing on a non-primary monitor
  pushed the window completely off-screen.

### Changed
- `ToggleKioskMode`: Kiosk button icon (`_winBtnKiosk.Text`) is only reset to
  `\uE92D` when *exiting* kiosk mode; the update when entering is skipped
  because the button is immediately hidden.
- **Tray menu – borderless toggle:** The alternating “Show title bar” /
  “Hide title bar” item is replaced by a persistent checkmark entry named
  “Borderless mode” (“Rahmenloser Modus” in German). The checkmark reflects
  whether borderless mode is currently active, clearly distinct from the
  separate Kiosk mode toggle.

### Internal
- Added Win32 constant `WM_GETMINMAXINFO = 0x0024`.
- Added private nested structs `POINT` and `MINMAXINFO` for use with
  `Marshal.PtrToStructure<MINMAXINFO>` in the `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` handler.

## [1.0.4] – Build artifact cleanup

### Changed
- `dotnet publish` with `-p:PublishSingleFile=true` no longer emits
  `SymconDashboard.pdb` or the NuGet IntelliSense XML files
  (`Microsoft.Web.WebView2.*.xml`) alongside the EXE.
  Controlled via `DebugType` and `AllowedReferenceRelatedFileExtensions`
  in the `.csproj` (active only during single-file publish).

---

## [1.0.3] – Tray icon profile label

### Added
- Tray icon tooltip shows the active profile name:
  *"Symcon Dashboard – profilename"* when launched with `--profile`,
  plain *"Symcon Dashboard"* otherwise.

---

## [1.0.2] – Kiosk mode & command-line options

### Added
- **Kiosk mode** (borderless only): fills the primary screen, sets `TopMost`,
  hides the taskbar entry. Toggled via tray menu or the kiosk caption button
  (`\uE92D` / `\uE92E`). State is persisted across restarts.
- **`--profile <name>`** CLI option: uses `<name>.json` as the settings file
  and `WebView2Data-<name>` as the browser cache folder, allowing multiple
  independent instances with separate configurations.
- **`--no-single-instance`** CLI option: skips the single-instance mutex so
  multiple instances can run without a profile name.
- Pre-kiosk window bounds are saved and restored when exiting kiosk mode.
  The `FormClosing` handler skips overwriting saved bounds while kiosk is active.

---

## [1.0.1] – Zoom control

### Added
- Zoom presets (75 % – 200 %) and a custom zoom input via tray menu.
- Zoom level is persisted in `appsettings.json` and restored on startup.
- Tray menu zoom checkmarks are refreshed live when the menu opens.

---

## [1.0.0] – Initial release

### Added
- Borderless WebView2 shell for IP-Symcon dashboards.
- Borderless mode with custom resize borders, drag strip, and caption buttons
  (close / maximize-restore / kiosk).
- System tray icon with context menu: toggle title bar, change URL, reload,
  reset position, zoom, border color, border width, exit.
- Border color modes: Windows accent color (`system`), auto-detected page
  background (`auto`), or custom hex color.
- Single-instance enforcement via named mutex; second instance brings the
  running window to the foreground.
- Window position, size, maximized state, and zoom factor persisted in
  `appsettings.json` next to the executable.
- First-run URL prompt.
- Error pages for HTTP errors (401, 403, 404, 500, 502, 503) and network
  errors (DNS, connection refused, timeout, …).
- Localized strings (English default + German `Strings.de.resx`).
