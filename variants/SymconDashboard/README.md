## Features

- **Borderless window** – frameless display by default, ideal for dashboard use
- **Resizable & draggable** – resize from all edges, drag from the top strip
- **Edge snap** – window edges snap flush to the working-area boundary of any connected monitor when dragged or resized within 16 px; pull the cursor 32 px away from the edge to release
- **Drag bar window controls** – four caption buttons in the top strip: Kiosk · Minimize · Maximize/Restore · Close (exits the app). Clicking the Windows taskbar button toggles minimize/restore.
- **System tray integration** – right-click the tray icon for the full menu; double-click or re-launch to restore the window
- **Single-instance** – launching the app a second time restores the existing window
- **Multiple pages** – configure any number of named pages (name + URL); switch instantly via the tray *Pages* submenu, the drag-bar list button (⊞), or the Page Manager dialog. The first entry is the startup page.
- **Page Manager** – dedicated dialog to add, rename, reorder and remove pages, including a per-page border color override (empty = global); *Apply* persists changes immediately without closing the dialog.
- **Taskbar icon toggle** – independently control whether the app appears in the Windows taskbar, regardless of borderless mode.
- **Configurable border color**
  - Windows accent color
  - Auto-detected from the page background
  - Custom hex color
  - Per-page override (empty = global)
- **Configurable border width** – presets or custom value (2–40 px)
- **Configurable zoom level** – presets (75–200 %) or custom value (25–500 %), saved across restarts
- **Kiosk mode** – one-click full-screen lockdown: `TopMost` + full current-screen bounds; toggle via drag bar button or tray menu
- **Persistent settings** – window position, size, URL and all preferences are saved automatically
- **First-run setup** – prompts for a URL on the first launch
- **Untrusted connections** – for local/intranet dashboards: `http` pages and `https` pages with invalid (e.g. self-signed) certificates load **without warnings** for the configured page hosts; login redirects and third-party hosts stay strictly validated
- **Error pages** – friendly error screens for HTTP and network failures
- **Localization** – English and German, automatically selected from Windows language settings

## Untrusted & Insecure Connections

This app is **designed for dashboards that run on plain `http` or use self-signed /
invalid TLS certificates** — typical for LAN devices (IP-Symcon, NAS, smart-home
gateways, etc.). Such pages are therefore handled **without a security warning**:

- **`http` pages (unencrypted)** are displayed without any warning.
- **`https` pages with invalid/untrusted certificates** are **accepted automatically**,
  but **only for the exact host + port of the pages configured in the Page Manager.**

**Scope:** The certificate exception applies solely to the matching host + port.
Redirects to other hosts (e.g. an external login provider), links to other servers
and embedded resources from third-party hosts are **validated strictly again** — the
usual certificate warning is shown there.

> **Security note:** This app is intended for **trusted local or intranet web
> front-ends only**. Data sent over `http` is **not encrypted**, and accepting an
> invalid certificate lets anyone who can impersonate the host intercept or modify
> the traffic. Run the app on trusted networks and use a proper HTTPS certificate
> for production systems.

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| Windows | 10 or 11 |
| [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) | any (included with Windows 11 and Microsoft Edge) |

---

## Installation

1. Download `SymconDashboard.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Apollo4244/WebAppDashboard/releases) page
2. **Move the EXE to a dedicated folder** (e.g. `C:\Tools\SymconDashboard\`) — do not run it directly from your Downloads folder
3. Run `SymconDashboard.exe` — no installation required
4. On first launch, enter the URL of your IP-Symcon web front-end (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:3777/`)

> **Tip:** The app creates additional files (`appsettings.json`, WebView2 cache) next to the EXE. Keeping it in its own folder prevents clutter in your Downloads folder.

No installer required.

## Command-line Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--profile <name>` | Use `<name>.json` as the settings file and a separate WebView2 cache — enables multiple independent instances side by side |
| `--no-single-instance` | Skip the single-instance check entirely (no mutex); useful for scripted or testing scenarios |

Both options can be combined. Examples:

```
SymconDashboard.exe --profile bedroom
SymconDashboard.exe --profile kitchen
SymconDashboard.exe --no-single-instance --profile debug
```

> **Note:** `--no-single-instance` without `--profile` shares the WebView2 cache between instances, which may cause the second instance to fail. Always pair it with `--profile` for reliable parallel use.
